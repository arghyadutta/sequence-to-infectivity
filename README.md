Okay, it's a small clickbait because the actual code is on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/arghyadutta/seq-to-infect). ðŸ˜€ I had to put it on GitLab since we needed more stroage space for storing the full outputs from Monte Carlo runs. Just putting the link here to have all of my public codebases in one place. 

From the GitLab repo's readme: 

> This repository contains code and data related to the paper: "Inverse design of viral infectivity-enhancing peptide fibrils from continuous protein-vector embeddings" by KÃ¼bra Kaygisiz, Arghya Dutta, Lena Rauch-Wirth, Christopher V. Synatschke, Jan MÃ¼nch, Tristan Bereau, and Tanja Weil; Biomaterials Science (2023) DOI: https://doi.org/10.1039/D3BM00412K. Please consider citing it if you find our code useful in your research.
